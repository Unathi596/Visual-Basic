- A program that calculates the semester and final mark of each module 
- Assumes that each student has less than or equals to three modules

- Each module is unique (It has it's own ways of calculating marks)

## Concepts Used ##
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Abstraction and encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Upcasting/ Downcasting
- Exception Handling
